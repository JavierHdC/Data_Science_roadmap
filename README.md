# Data_Science_roadmap
Hello everyone!

My name is Javier, and I am an enthusiastic MSc student specializing in Bioinformatics with a deep passion for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This repository serves as a structured roadmap of my journey toward mastering Data Science and AI.

In this repository, I will be following the comprehensive roadmap outlined on https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist, diligently working through various exercises and projects. My goal is to apply what I learn, share my progress, and build a solid foundation in Data Science and AI.

I hope you find this repository both useful and inspiring as you embark on or continue your own learning journey.

Feel free to contact, explore, contribute, and learn alongside me!
